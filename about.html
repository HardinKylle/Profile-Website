  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Hello, I'm <span class="highlight-name">Kylle Marius M. Hardin</span>, a fourth-year Computer Science student
    specializing in
    Software Engineering at FEU Institute of Technology. My path into programming wasn't
    straightforward. I came to it without any background in high school, initially drawn by
    practical considerations about career prospects. What I discovered, however, was something
    far more meaningful: a genuine love for problem-solving and the deep satisfaction that comes
    from making things work, especially when I don't initially know how.
  </p>

  <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    I'm particularly drawn to web development, where I find joy in the entire process, from
    conceptualizing a solution to debugging every detail until it functions just right. Through
    my college years, one experience stands out:<span class="highlight-name"> our thesis project</span>, where we
    developed a system
    for life-saving disaster response. The challenge of building something that could genuinely
    <span class="highlight-name"> help people </span>in critical situations pushed me to grow both technically and as a
    developer who
    understands the real-world impact of our work.
  </p>

  <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Beyond programming, I'm drawn to<span class="highlight-name"> classical and philosophical literature </span>, with
    Marcus Aurelius's
    Meditations as my constant companion. Philosophy and programming share a fundamental connection:
    both are rooted in <span class="highlight-name"> logic and reasoning </span>. Just as philosophers examine how
    humans think and make sense of the world, programmers construct systems through logical frameworks. There's
    something
    profound in this: reasoning, perhaps humanity's defining trait, expressed whether through both programming or philosophy.
  </p>

  <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Looking ahead, I envision starting my career in a software or tech company, immersing myself
    in the <span class ="highlight-name">  practical realities</span> of the industry, because real-world development is vastly different
    from academic theory. From there, I aim to work my way toward larger companies, continuously
    learning and refining my craft. Ultimately, I hope to establish my own venture, applying
    everything I've learned to build something meaningful on my own terms.
