      <h3>The Trap of 'What If'</h3>
      <p>
        In technology, it's incredibly easy to get caught in a cycle of regret. "What if I had started LeetCode earlier?" "What if I had learned that framework when it first came out?" We look at the past and see a series of missed opportunities or mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
        This focus on what we *didn't* do is a trap. It drains energy from the only place where we have any power: <span class="highlight-name">the present</span>. Dwelling on past mistakes doesn't fix them; it only stops us from making future progress.

      <h3>My Philosophy: Focus Forward</h3>
      <p>
        I believe we should focus on what we have right now, take advantage of it, and just move forward toward our goals. We cannot change the past, but we have complete control over our next step.
      </p>
      <p>
        For me, this philosophy means:
      </p>
      <ul class="advocacy-list">
        <li>Acknowledging past mistakes, learning the lesson, and then letting them go.</li>
        <li>Focusing on the skills we can build today, not the ones we wish we had yesterday.</li>
        <li>Embracing the journey of continuous learning, one day at a time.</li>
        <li>Setting clear goals and taking consistent, even if imperfect, action towards them.</li>
      </ul>
