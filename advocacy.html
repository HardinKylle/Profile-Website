      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        In an era where artificial intelligence can generate convincing deepfakes and misinformation
        spreads faster than truth, digital literacy is no longer optional—it's essential for democracy
        itself. The Philippines faces a critical challenge: while internet penetration grows rapidly,
        understanding of how digital systems work lags behind, leaving our most vulnerable communities,
        particularly the elderly and economically disadvantaged, susceptible to manipulation.

      <p>
        The consequences extend beyond individual deception. When large segments of our population lack
        the tools to critically evaluate online information, it affects our collective decision-making,
        from elections to public health responses. This digital divide isn't just about access to
        technology—it's about access to truth and the ability to participate meaningfully in our
        increasingly digital society.

        bringing practical digital literacy programs to underserved Filipino communities, with special
        emphasis on helping people understand:
